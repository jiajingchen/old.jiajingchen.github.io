title: Kaggle, Here I come!
---


Participating in Kaggle competitions has always been on my data science To-Do list! I have been to a lot of meet-ups and events about kaggle, but I don't really have much time dedicated to it. But this time, I am serious. I plan to crack some competitions during this summer:)

Here are my detailed ojectives:
Find a NLP related competition and enjoying it!

The reason I choose NLP instead of others is partially because of the limit of current computational power. Don't want to crush my Macbook running CNN :)  Also, I have been very interested in LSTM models and encoding methods in text mining. Hopefully I will get more familiar with it!
