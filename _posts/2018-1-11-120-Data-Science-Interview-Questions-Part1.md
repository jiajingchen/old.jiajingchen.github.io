Let's crack the data science interview together! Recently I found this amazing [120 Data Science Interview Questions](http://www.datasciencequestions.com) written by [William Chen](http://www.wzchen.com) and other data scientists. I shared with some of my data science friends and classmates. We decided to first do all the problem set on our own and then discuss it together. Here is some of the answer I have for those questions. I also refer to other source like Google , Quora, Stack Overflow, etc.

Some useful link by the way:
- Here is the ["official" answers](https://datascienceinterview.quora.com/Answers-1) by the book author, but only part of the question exposed. 
- [Here, The DS Interview](https://www.thedsinterview.com) is another interesting website about data science interview and how to prepare it. I like the UI design and kind of the game play behind it.

All right, let's get started with predictive modeling first!

### Q1

(Given a Dataset) Analyze this dataset and give me a model that can predict this response variable.

#### Ans:
This depends on the given dataset and the question behind the dataset. Generally, we need to clarify the type of prediction we want to implement. For supervised learning, we need to define whether it is a regression or classification problem.

### Q2
What could be some issues if the distribution of the test data is signicantly different than the distribution of the training data? 

### Q3
