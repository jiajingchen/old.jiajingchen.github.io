title: The start of data science summer internship
---

I have just finished my first year at Harvard Chan School. Right after my finals, I packed all my luggages and moved to Columbus, Ohio. I will be working as a data science intern at Nationwide headquarter here at Columbus.

This is a brand new start for my career in data science and I will update my experience as a data science intern in this blog!
