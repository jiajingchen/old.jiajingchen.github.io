title: Craking the "Quant" Interview
---



#### Books that I recommended
Here are some books and materials that can help you prepare your "quant" job interview:

- The "Green" book
[A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance Interviews ](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Quantitative-Finance-Interviews/dp/1438236662)

I used this book to prepare for my interviews last year. Some questions seems a little bit old-fashioned but overall this is a great book to help you review the maths and stat foundations you need, and some tips for interview. I would say that this book really help me a lot, I was even asked some similar questions during the superday.

- The "Red" book
[Heard on The Street: Quantitative Questions from Wall Street Job Interviews](https://www.amazon.com/Heard-Street-Quantitative-Questions-Interviews/dp/0994118252/ref=pd_sim_14_5?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0994118252&pd_rd_r=DPZESW7BYA7A7AC2WPYN&pd_rd_w=uaLYj&pd_rd_wg=xIepr&psc=1&refRID=DPZESW7BYA7A7AC2WPYN)

I didn't use the red book, but intended to review it before my full-time job hunting season. I heard from others that some questions are really interesting, especially the stochastic processes, Markov Chain part.

- Some more probability questions, if interested
[Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions ](https://www.amazon.com/Challenging-Problems-Probability-Solutions-Mathematics/dp/0486653552/ref=pd_sim_14_4?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0486653552&pd_rd_r=WQ4YZKYEFTN290593V1B&pd_rd_w=ACLPw&pd_rd_wg=cem03&psc=1&refRID=WQ4YZKYEFTN290593V1B)

I recently bought this book at the Harvard COOP and really liked it! Some questions are familiar but some are very sophisticated and challenging. 


#### About my own interview experience

I have been interviewed with some companies (investment banks and HFs) on Wall Streets but I didn't get the internship offer from them at last. But the experience is very precious to me though. I will, at certain point, share something about it, I promise! 

This semester I have took STAT171: Introduction to Stochastic Processes, which is a great undergraduate course. Although my original goal for taking this course is to just challenge myself and learn it for fun, some materials may also help to prepare the "Quant" job interview on wall street.

Well, that's it. Have fun reading the book and good luck for your quant interviews!
