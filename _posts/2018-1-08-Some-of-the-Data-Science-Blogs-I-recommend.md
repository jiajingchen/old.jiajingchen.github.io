Here is some blogs in data science I like to read and highly recommend:) 

[David Robinson's blog](http://varianceexplained.org)
David Robinson is a data scientist at Stack Overflow.
By the way, I also like the name "variance explained"!


[Willian Chen's blog](http://www.wzchen.com)
Willian Chen is a data scientist at Quora. There are a lot of things to explore on his amazing website. For example, the [Probability Cheatsheet](http://www.wzchen.com/probability-cheatsheet) is extremely helpful. Also, check out the [data science handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com) which is a must for data science interview prep!


[Simply Statistics](https://simplystatistics.org)
A statistics blog by Rafael Irizarry, Roger Peng, and Jeff Leek, Professors in Biostatistics. Rafa is also the instructor of the [Intro to Data Science course](http://datasciencelabs.github.io) I took in 2017 Fall semester.


[FastML](http://fastml.com)
The blog was started by Zygmunt (an economist) with a vision to make Machine Learning as easy as possible.  The writers of this blog share plenty of useful tips on how to use machine learning to solve complex business problems.
