I have just finished my first semester at Harvard Chan School and was very enjoying a short winter break from school. I started to look back on the courses I took so far and some data science and programming I was getting into for the last few months. Before I started my graduate school study, I did a lot of related data science courses and research project in applied machine learning for about two years. I was luck in a sense that those experience gave me a sound foundation for what has been coming up next in my journey to be a data scientist.

I am a faster learning and everyday l am actively learning, growing as an aspiring data scientist, with yet another year ahead in graduate school learning more about statistical methods, algorithms and data structure, machine learning, deep learning, etc.

As I was reading other people’s blogs in data science on a daily basis (I would say more frequent than twitter and Facebook:), I realized that writing a blog in data science and start something interesting is very important. I also get inspired by [David Robinson’s blog--Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org). David was a guest lecturer in our Introduction to data science course last fall taught by Professor Rafael Irizarry, and presented a great demonstration in texting mining using library tidyverse and sentimental analysis. In his recent post in the blog, he explained that why a data science blog is particularly valuable to people at the start of their career.

And today, the start of 2018, I finally start a blog of my journey in data science! (Cheers!)

Here is a list of things I will mainly talk about in this blog:

- Some interesting data science interview questions and preparation
- Machine Learning and Kaggle Competition
- Some Maths, Probability and Statistics
- Programming in R and Python
- Some Hands-on experience in the industry (when I start my career in data science in the near future:)

Here is some of my new year resolution related to my career development in data science:
