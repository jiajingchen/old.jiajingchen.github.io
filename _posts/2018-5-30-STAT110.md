### STAT 110

Last semester, I watched the videos of STAT 110 Probability by Professor Joe Blitzstein on [Youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo) for 3 times! I even listened to it before I slept on a daily basis! I was really into probability and also this course give me a solid foundation for another stat course I took: STAT 171 Introductions to stochastics processes. You can tell that probability is the pre-requisite for sure!

If you want to understand probability, distribution, and conditional probability better, don't forget to check out [the course website](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110). There are a lot of materials you could learn and practice. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=dzFf3r1yph8) is also very interesting. 

### The soul of statistics 

I am here quoting Joe's saying in the lecture:

"Conditional is the soul of statistics."

P.S. I recently heard from Joe's twitter that "He is working on developing an edX version of Stat 110, and that will indeed have a certificate of completion."

Hopefully the course will be launched on EdX soon!
