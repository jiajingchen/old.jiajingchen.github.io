title: The Deep Learning Project: Facial Expression Classification, CNN
---

This semester I took BST261: Data Science II, mostly about deep learning in Python. The final project is using CNN in Facial Expression Classification.

Our project is from Kaggle competition--[Facial Expression Recognition Challenge] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge)


Here is my [Github repo](https://github.com/jiajingchen/Deep-Learning-Project-Facial-Expression-Classification) for this project.
