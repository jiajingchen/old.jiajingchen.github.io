Hi! This is Jiajing Chen.

I am a master student at Harvard University, focusing on Computational Biology, Biostatistics and Health Data Science. I am an aspiring data scientist and enthusiast in machine learning applications.

### Miscellaneous

I am very interested in mathematics (both pure maths and applied maths), logic and programming.

I am also a self-taught artist. [Here](https://jiajingchen.github.io/art/) is some of my artwork
