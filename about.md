Hi! This is Jiajing Chen. I am a master student at Harvard University, focusing on Computational Biology, Biostatistics and Data Science. I am an aspiring data scientist and enthusiast in machine learning applications.

### Miscellaneous

I am very interested in mathematics (both pure maths and applied maths), logic and programming.

I am also a self-taught artist. [Here](https://jiajingchen.github.io/arts/) is some of my artwork. I like photography and [here](https://jiajingchen.github.io/photos/) is some of my exploration of the world around me.
