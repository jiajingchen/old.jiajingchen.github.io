Here is some of the projects I have done in the past or have been working on:

## Projects I have done before:

[Araubisite](http://systbio.cau.edu.cn/araubisite/index.php)



### Kaggle competition: House Price Prediction, Oct-Dec, 2017

This is also our group project for [BST260: Introduction to Data Science course](http://datasciencelabs.github.io) at Harvard School of Public Health. I was mainly responsible for machine learning implementation and ensemble methods, as well as the front-end design of the project website.

See [our Github page](https://github.com/BST260-final-group-project) and our [project website here](https://jiajingchen.github.io/bst260final-project-house-price/).
