Here is some of the projects I have been working on:

# Kaggle competition: House Price Prediction, Oct-Dec, 2017

This is also our group project for [BST260: Introduction to Data Science course]() at Harvard Chan School. I was mainly responsible for machine learning implementation and ensemble methods, as well as the front-end design of the project website.

See [our Github page]() and our [project website here]().

# Araubisite: Machine Learning Prediction tools for biologist to use
